        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p id="pd">
            Hello, everyone I am Shlok of class 9th. Today on this blog I am explaining About my project 'SHLOKA Ai Assistant'. It is an A.i. which is developed using "Python Programming Language". 
            <b>Python : </b>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
             Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected 
             <br>
             I hope that you heard about Alexa Sire Google_Assistant Cortana. They are Ai assistants. Similarly, SHLOKA is also an ai assistant the word SHLOKA is not a name or word it is an abbreviation. b>SHLOKA:</b>
             <i>Scientific Honest Loyal Obeyed Kind Assistance</i>
             I aim  'to make AI common and relatable in our life, especially in the Indian middle-class
             family'. Although it is not having intelligence but  it can do many things.
